 * @class SBMLError
 * @sbmlbrief{core} An error, warning or other diagnostic.
 *
 * @htmlinclude not-sbml-warning.html
 *
 * When a libSBML operation on SBML content results in an error, or when
 * there is something wrong with the SBML content, the problems are
 * reported as SBMLError objects.  These are generally stored in an
 * SBMLErrorLog object; this log object, in turn, is kept in the
 * SBMLDocument object containing the SBML content.  Applications can
 * obtain the list of logged errors using SBMLDocument::getErrorLog() and
 * then use the methods provided by SBMLErrorLog to access individual
 * SBMLError objects.  (Note that despite the word "error" in the name,
 * SBMLError objects are used to represent not only "true" errors, but also
 * warnings and some informational diagnostics.  The name is a historical
 * hold-over from early versions of libSBML, in which the object really was
 * only used to report errors.)
 *
 * @if clike
 * Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
 * identifies the nature of the problem.  This "error id" number will be up
 * to five digits long, and it will be listed in one of two enumerations:
 * <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> SBMLErrorCode_t</a> (described <a
 * class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> below</a>) or @link
 * XMLError::XMLErrorCode_t XMLErrorCode_t@endlink (described in the
 * documentation for the class XMLError).  The former enumeration contains
 * all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the appendices of the
 * SBML specification documents, as well as some additional
 * libSBML-specific error codes.
 * @endif@if java
 * Each SBMLError object instance has an identification number that
 * identifies the nature of the problem.  This "error id" number will be up
 * to five digits long, and it will come from one of two sets of static
 * integer constants defined in the interface class <code><a
 * href="libsbmlConstants.html"> libsbmlConstants</a></code>: either the
 * SBML error identifiers <a class="el" href="#SBMLErrorCode_t"> (described
 * below)</a> or the XML error identifiers (described in the documentation
 * for the class <code><a href="XMLError.html"> XMLError</a></code>).  The
 * former set of constants includes all the SBML validation rule numbers
 * listed in the appendices of the SBML specification documents, as well as
 * some additional libSBML-specific error codes.

 * The former set of constants
 * includes all the SBML validation rule numbers listed in the appendices
 * of the SBML specification documents, as well as some additional
 * libSBML-specific error codes.
 * @endif@~
 *
 * Error codes are useful mainly for software.  For human readers,
 * SBMLError also includes text messages that describe the nature of a
 * given problem.  The messages can be accessed using
 * SBMLError::getShortMessage() and SBMLError::getMessage().  The former
 * provides a brief one-line description of the issue, while
 * SBMLError::getMessage() provides a more detailed text, including (if
 * appropriate) references to sections of the SBML specifications where
 * relevant topics are discussed.  These text strings are suitable for
 * displaying to human users.
 *
 * @if clike
 * An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
 * retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
 * are drawn from the enumeration <a class="el"
 * href="#SBMLErrorCategory_t">SBMLErrorCategory_t</a> described below.
 * Categories are used to partition errors into distinct conceptual groups.
 * This is principally used by the libSBML validation system to group
 * classes of validation checks.  For example,
 * @sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY, SBMLErrorCategory_t}
 * is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
 * @sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY, SBMLErrorCategory_t}
 * is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
 * so on.
 * @endif@if java
 * An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
 * retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
 * are drawn from a set of static integer constants
 * defined in <code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>,
 * and having names beginning with the characters
 * <code>LIBSBML_CAT_</code>.  The list of possible codes is described in a
 * separate section below.  Categories are used to partition errors into
 * distinct conceptual groups.  This is principally used by the libSBML
 * validation system to group classes of validation checks.  For example,
 * @sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_CAT_IDENTIFIER_CONSISTENCY, SBMLErrorCategory_t}
 * is the category for tests that check identifier consistency;
 * @sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY, SBMLErrorCategory_t}
 * is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
 * so on.
 * @endif@if python
 * An SBMLError object also contains a category code; its value may be
 * retrieved using the method SBMLError::getCategory().  Category values
 * are drawn from a set of static integer constants
 * defined in @link libsbml libsbml@endlink and having names beginning with the characters
 * <code>LIBSBML_CAT_</code>.  The list of possible codes is described in a

 * @sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_CAT_MATHML_CONSISTENCY, SBMLErrorCategory_t}
 * is the category for MathML consistency checking; and
 * so on.
 * @endif@~
 *
 * In addition, SBMLError also has a severity code.  Its value may be
 * retrieved using the method SBMLError::getSeverity().  The possible
 * severity values are the same as those reported by @if clike XMLError.@endif@if python XMLError.@endif@if java <code><a href="XMLError.html">XMLError</a></code>.@endif@~
 * Severity levels currently range from informational
 * (@sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_SEV_INFO, XMLErrorSeverity_t})
 * to fatal errors
 * (@sbmlconstant{LIBSBML_SEV_FATAL, XMLErrorSeverity_t}).
 * They can be
 * used by an application to evaluate how serious a given problem
 * is.
 *
 * SBMLError also tracks the Level&nbsp;3 package extension, if any, was
 * responsible for a given warning or error.  Each diagnostic code logged by
 * an libSBML extension for SBML Level&nbsp;3 packages includes a record of
 * the package that logged it.  It can be retrieved using
 * SBMLError::getPackage().  The information is a simple text string; the
 * string will be the nickname of the package, such as @c "comp" for the
 * Hierarchical %Model Composition package, @c "fbc" for the Flux Balance
 * Constraints package, and so on.  If the value returned by
 * SBMLError::getPackage() is an empty string or has the value @c "core",
 * then the error came from libSBML core.
 *
 * Finally, SBMLError records the line and column near where the problem
 * occurred in the SBML content.  The values may be retrieved using the
 * methods SBMLError::getLine() and SBMLError::getColumn().  We say "near",
 * because a lot of factors affect how accurate the line/column information
 * ultimately is.  For example, different XML parsers have different
 * conventions for which line and column number they report for a
 * particular problem (which makes a difference when a problem involves an
 * opening XML tag on one line and a closing tag on another line).  In some
 * situations, some parsers report invalid line and/or column numbers
 * altogether.  If this occurs, libSBML sets the line and/or column number
 * in the SBMLError object to the the value of the maximum unsigned long
 * integer representable on the platform where libSBML is running.  (This
 * is equal to the constant named <code>ULONG_MAX</code> in C and C++.)
 * The probability that a true line or column number in an SBML model would
 * equal this value is vanishingly small; thus, if an application
 * encounters these values in an XMLError object, it can assume no valid
 * line/column number could be provided by libSBML in that situation.

 * <h3><a class="anchor" name="SBMLErrorCode_t">SBMLErrorCode_t</a></h3>
 *
 * #SBMLErrorCode_t is an enumeration of all SBML-level error, warning and
 * informational diagnostic codes.  Every SBMLError object has an error
 * code value that can be either a value from this enumeration, or a value
 * from the #XMLErrorCode_t
 * enumeration (see the documentation for XMLError).  The latter values
 * apply when the error or warning signifies a basic XML issue rather than
 * an SBML issue per se.  The values of #SBMLErrorCode_t are distinguished
 * from those of #XMLErrorCode_t by
 * being numbered 10000 and higher, while the XML layer's codes are 9999 and
 * lower.  The method SBMLError::getErrorId() returns the error code of a
 * given SBMLError object instance.
 *
 * The following is a table of the symbolic names of #SBMLErrorCode_t values
 * and the meaning of each code.  In this table, the right-hand columns
 * titled "L1V1", "L1V2", etc. refer to Levels and Versions of the SBML
 * specifications, and the entries in each column refer to whether the
 * severity of the condition in that particular Level+Version of SBML.
 * The codes stand for the following:

 * The error and warning codes returned by libSBML are listed in the table

 * given SBMLError object instance.  In the libSBML Java language
 * interface, these error identifiers are currently
 * implemented as static integer constants defined in the interface class
 * <code><a href="libsbmlConstants.html">libsbmlConstants</a></code>.  This
 * is admittedly not an ideal approach from the standpoint of modern Java
 * programming, but it was necessary to work around the lack of
 * enumerations in Java prior to JDK 1.5.  Future versions of libSBML may
 * use a proper Java enumeration type to define the error identifiers.
 *
 * In this table, the right-hand columns titled "L1V1", "L1V2", etc. refer

 * @ifnot clike However, in the language interfaces other than C++, all
 * libSBML error codes are ultimately represented as integer constants rather
 * than separate enumerations lists, and they are all stored in a single
 * interface class.  Codes from different libSBML extensions have names that
 * begin with the package's nickname, such as <code>Qual</code> for
 * the Qualitative Models package, <code>Layout</code> for the Layout
